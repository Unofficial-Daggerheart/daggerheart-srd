    <h3>Level 1 Sage Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>When you're tracking a
    specific creature or group of creatures based on signs of their passage, you
    can spend any number of Hope and ask the GM that many questions from the
    following list: What direction did they go? How long ago did they pass
    through? What were they doing in this location? How many of them were here?
    When you encounter creatures you've tracked in this way, gain a +1 bonus to
    your Evasion against them.</p>
