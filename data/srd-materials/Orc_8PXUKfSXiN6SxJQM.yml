    <p>Orcs are humanoids most easily recognized by their square features and
    boar-like tusks that protrude from their lower jaw.</p><p
    class="og-omit">Tusks come in various sizes, and though they extend from the
    mouth, they aren't used for consuming food. Instead, many orcs choose to
    decorate their tusks with significant ornamentation. Orcs typically live for
    125 years, and unless altered, their tusks continue to grow throughout the
    course of their lives. Their ears are pointed, and their hair and skin
    typically have green, blue, pink, or gray tones. Orcs tend toward a muscular
    build, and their average height ranges from 5–6½ feet (1.5–2.0 m).</p><h4

    attack against a target within Melee range, you can spend a Hope to gore the
    target with your tusks, dealing an extra <strong>1d6</strong> damage.</p>
