  description: >-
    <p>Faeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features.</p><p
    class="og-omit">These characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid
    to insectoid—some possess additional arms, compound eyes, lantern organs,
    chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers.</p><p class="og-omit">Because of their
    close ties to the natural world, they also frequently possess attributes
    that allow them to blend in with various plants. The average height of a
    faerie ranges from about 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m), but some faeries grow up to 7
    feet (2.1 m) tall. All faeries possess membranous wings and they each go
    through a process of metamorphosis. The process and changes differ from
    faerie to faerie, but during this transformation each individual manifests
    the unique appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their
    approximately 50-year lifespan.</p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
