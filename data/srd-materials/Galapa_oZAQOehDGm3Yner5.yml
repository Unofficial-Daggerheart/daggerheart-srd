  description: >-
    <p>Galapa resemble anthropomorphic turtles with large, domed shells into
    which they can retract. <span class="og-omit">On average, they range from
    4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) in height, and their head and body shapes can resemble
    any type of turtle.</span></p><p class="og-omit">Galapa come in a variety of
    earth tones—most often shades of green and brown— and possess unique
    patterns on their shells. Members of this ancestry can draw their head,
    arms, and legs into their shell for protection to use it as a natural shield
    when defensive measures are needed. Some supplement their shell's strength
    or appearance by attaching armor or carving unique designs, but the process
    is exceedingly painful. Most galapa move slowly no matter their age, and
    they can live approximately 150 years.</p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
