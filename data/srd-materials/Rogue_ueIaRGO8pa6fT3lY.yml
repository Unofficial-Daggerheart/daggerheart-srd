    <p>Rogues are scoundrels, often in both attitude and practice. <span
    class="og-omit">Broadly known as liars and thieves, the best among this
    class move through the world anonymously. Utilizing their sharp wits and
    blades, rogues trick their foes through social manipulation as easily as
    breaking locks, climbing through windows, or dealing underhanded blows.
    These masters of magical craft manipulate shadow and movement, adding an
    array of useful and deadly tools to their repertoire. Rogues frequently
    establish guilds to meet future accomplices, hire out jobs, and hone secret
    skills, proving that there's honor among thieves for those who know where to
    look.</span></p><p><span

    you would be Hidden, you are instead <em>Cloaked</em>. In addition to the
    benefits of the Hidden condition, while <em>Cloaked</em> you remain unseen
    if you are stationary when an adversary moves to where they would normally
    see you. After you make an attack or end a move within line of sight of an
    adversary, you are no longer <em>Cloaked</em>. Otherwise, this bonus lasts
    until your next rest.</p><p><em><strong>Sneak Attack:</strong></em> When you
    succeed on an attack while <em>Cloaked</em> or while an ally is within Melee
    range of your target, add a number of <strong>d6s</strong> equal to your
    tier to your damage roll.</p>
