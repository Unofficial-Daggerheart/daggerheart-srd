    <h3>Level 4 Codex Grimoire</h3><p>Recall Cost: 3</p><p>Repudiate: You can
    interrupt a magical effect taking place. Make a reaction roll using your
    Spellcast trait. Once per rest on a success, the effect stops and any
    consequences are avoided. Create Construct: Spend a Hope to choose a group
    of objects around you and create an animated construct from them that obeys
    basic commands. Make a Spellcast Roll to command them to take action. When
    necessary, they share your Evasion and traits and their attacks deal 2d10+3
    physical damage. You can only maintain one construct at a time, and they
    fall apart when they take any amount of damage.</p>
