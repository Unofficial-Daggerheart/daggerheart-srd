    <h3>Level 6 Arcana Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    (15). On a success, you place an arcane marking on the ground where you
    currently stand. The next time you successfully cast Rift Walker, a rift in
    space opens up, providing safe passage back to the exact spot where the
    marking was placed. This rift stays open until you choose to close it or you
    cast another spell. You can drop the spell at any time to cast Rift Walker
    again and place the marking somewhere new.</p>
