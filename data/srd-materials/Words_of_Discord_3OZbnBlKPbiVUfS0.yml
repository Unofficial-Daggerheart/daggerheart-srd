    <h3>Level 5 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Whisper words of discord
    to an adversary within Melee range and make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a
    success, the target must mark a Stress and make an attack against another
    adversary instead of against you or your allies. Once this attack is over,
    the target realizes what happened. The next time you cast Words of Discord
    on them, gain a -5 penalty to the Spellcast Roll.</p>
