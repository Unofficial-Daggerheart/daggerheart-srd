    <h3>Level 8 Splendor Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Mark a Stress to cast
    a protective aura on a target within Very Close range. When the target marks
    an Armor Slot, they reduce the severity of the attack by an additional
    threshold. If this spell causes a creature who would be damaged to instead
    mark no Hit Points, the effect ends. You can only hold Shield Aura on one
    creature at a time.</p>
