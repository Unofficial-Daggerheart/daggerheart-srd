    <h3>Level 6 Codex Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Mark an adversary within
    Close range with a sigil of retribution. The GM gains a Fear. When the
    marked adversary deals damage to you or your allies, place a d8 on this
    card. You can hold a number of d8s equal to your level. When you
    successfully attack the marked adversary, roll the dice on this card and add
    the total to your damage roll, then clear the dice. This effect ends when
    the marked adversary is defeated or you cast Sigil of Retribution again.</p>
