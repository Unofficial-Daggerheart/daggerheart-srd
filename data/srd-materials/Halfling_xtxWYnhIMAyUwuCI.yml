  description: >-
    <p>Halflings are small humanoids with large hairy feet and prominent rounded
    ears. <span class="og-omit">On average, halflings are 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m)
    in height, and their ears, nose, and feet are larger in proportion to the
    rest of their body. Members of this ancestry live for around 150 years, and
    a halfling's appearance is likely to remain youthful even as they progress
    from adulthood into old age. Halflings are naturally attuned to the magnetic
    fields of the Mortal Realm, granting them a strong internal compass. They
    also possess acute senses of hearing and smell, and can often detect those
    who are familiar to them by the sound of their movements.</span></p><h4
