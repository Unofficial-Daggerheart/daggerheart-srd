    <h3>Level 7 Arcana Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>When you make a
    successful Spellcast Roll to cast a different spell, you can spend a Hope to
    become Cloaked. While Cloaked, you remain unseen if you are stationary when
    an adversary moves to where they would normally see you. When you move into
    or within an adversary's line of sight or make an attack, you are no longer
    Cloaked.</p>
