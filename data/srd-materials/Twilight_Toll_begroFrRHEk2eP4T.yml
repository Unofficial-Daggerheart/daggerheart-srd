    <h3>Level 9 Midnight Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Choose a target
    within Far range. When you succeed on an action roll against them that
    doesn't result in making a damage roll, place a token on this card. When you
    deal damage to this target, spend any number of tokens to add a d12 for each
    token spent to your damage roll. You can only hold Twilight Toll on one
    creature at a time. When you choose a new target or take a rest, clear all
    unspent tokens.</p>
