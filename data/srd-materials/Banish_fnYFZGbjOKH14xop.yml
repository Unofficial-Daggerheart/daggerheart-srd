    <h3>Level 6 Codex Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    against a target within Close range. On a success, roll a number of d20s
    equal to your Spellcast trait. The target must make a Reaction Roll with a
    Difficulty equal to your highest result. On a success, the target must mark
    a Stress but isn't banished. Once per rest on a failure, they are banished
    from this realm. When the PCs roll with Fear, the Difficulty gains a -1
    penalty and the target makes another reaction roll. On a success, they
    return from banishment.</p>
