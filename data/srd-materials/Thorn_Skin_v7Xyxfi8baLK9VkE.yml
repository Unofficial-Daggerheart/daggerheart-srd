    <h3>Level 5 Sage Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Once per rest, spend a
    Hope to sprout thorns all over your body. When you do, place a number of
    tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card. When you take damage, you
    can spend any number of tokens to roll that number of d6s. Add the results
    together and reduce the incoming damage by that amount. If you're within
    Melee range of the attacker, deal that amount of damage back to them. When
    you take a rest, clear all unspent tokens.</p>
