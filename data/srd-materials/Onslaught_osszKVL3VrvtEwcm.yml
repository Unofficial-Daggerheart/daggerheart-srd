    <h3>Level 10 Blade Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 3</p><p>When you successfully
    make an attack with your weapon, you never deal damage beneath a target's
    Major damage threshold (the target always marks a minimum of 2 Hit Points).
    Additionally, when a creature within your weapon's range deals damage to an
    ally with an attack that doesn't include you, you can mark a Stress to force
    them to make a Reaction Roll (15). On a failure, the target must mark a Hit
    Point.</p>
