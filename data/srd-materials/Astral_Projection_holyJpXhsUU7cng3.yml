    <h3>Level 8 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>Once per long rest, mark
    a Stress to create a projected copy of yourself that can appear anywhere
    you've been before. You can see and hear through the projection as though it
    were you and affect the world as though you were there. A creature
    investigating the projection can tell it's of magical origin. This effect
    lasts until your next rest or your projection takes any damage.</p>
