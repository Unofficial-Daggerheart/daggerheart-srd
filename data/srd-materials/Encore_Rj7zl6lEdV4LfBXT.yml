    <h3>Level 10 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>When an ally within
    Close range deals damage to an adversary, you can make a Spellcast Roll
    against that same target. On a success, you deal the same damage to the
    target that your ally dealt. If your Spellcast Roll succeeds with Fear,
    place this card in your vault.</p>
