    <h3>Level 2 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    against a target within Very Close range. On a success, they can't lie to
    you while they remain within Close range, but they are not compelled to
    speak. If you ask them a question and they refuse to answer, they must mark
    a Stress and the effect ends. The target is typically unaware this spell has
    been cast on them until it causes them to utter the truth.</p>
