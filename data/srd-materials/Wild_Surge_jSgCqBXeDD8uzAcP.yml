    <h3>Level 7 Sage Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Once per long rest, mark
    a Stress to channel the natural world around you and enhance yourself.
    Describe how your appearance changes, then place a d6 on this card with the
    1 value facing up. While the Wild Surge Die is active, you add its value to
    every action roll you make. After you add its value to a roll, increase the
    Wild Surge Die's value by one. When the die's value would exceed 6 or you
    take a rest, this form drops and you must mark an additional Stress.</p>
