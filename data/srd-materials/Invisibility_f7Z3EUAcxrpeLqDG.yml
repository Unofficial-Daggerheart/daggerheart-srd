    <h3>Level 3 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    (10). On a success, mark a Stress and choose yourself or an ally within
    Melee range to become Invisible. An Invisible creature can't be seen except
    through magical means and attack rolls against them are made with
    disadvantage. Place a number of tokens on this card equal to your Spellcast
    trait. When the Invisible creature takes an action, spend a token from this
    card. After the action that spends the last token is resolved, the effect
    ends. You can only hold Invisibility on one creature at a time.</p>
