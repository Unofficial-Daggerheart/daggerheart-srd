    <p>Elves are typically tall humanoids with pointed ears and acutely attuned
    senses. <span class="og-omit">Their ears vary in size and pointed shape, and
    as they age, the tips begin to droop. While elves come in a wide range of
    body types, they are all fairly tall, with heights ranging from about 6–6½
    feet (1.8–2.0 m). All elves have the ability to drop into a celestial
    trance, rather than sleep. This allows t</span>hem to rest ef<span
    class="og-omit">fectively in a short amount of time. Some elves possess what
    is known as a <strong>mystic form</strong>, which occurs when an elf has
    dedicated themself to the study or protection of the natural world so deeply
    that their physical form changes. These characteristics can include
    celestial freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their hair,
    eyes that flicker like fire, and more. Sometimes these traits are inherited
    from parents, but if an elf changes their environment or magical focus,
    their appearance changes over time. Because elves live for about 350 years,
    these traits can shift more than once throughout their
    lifespan.</span></p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
