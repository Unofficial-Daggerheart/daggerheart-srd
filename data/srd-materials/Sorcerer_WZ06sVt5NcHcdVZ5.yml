  description: >-
    <p>Not all innate magic users choose to hone their craft, but those who do
    can become powerful sorcerers. <span class="og-omit">The gifts of these
    wielders are passed down through families, even if the family is unaware of
    or reluctant to practice them. A sorcerer's abilities can range from the
    elemental to the illusionary and beyond, and many practitioners band
    together into collectives based on their talents. The act of becoming a
    formidable sorcerer is not the practice of acquiring power, but learning to
    cultivate and control the power one already possesses. The magic of a
    misguided or undisciplined sorcerer is a dangerous force
    indeed.</span></p><p><span
