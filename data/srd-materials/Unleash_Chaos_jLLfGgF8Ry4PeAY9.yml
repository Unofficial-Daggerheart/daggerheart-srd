    <h3>Level 1 Arcana Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>At the beginning of a
    session, place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this
    card. Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Far range and spend any
    number of tokens to channel raw energy from within yourself to unleash
    against them. On a success, roll a number of d10s equal to the tokens you
    spent and deal that much magic damage to the target. Mark a Stress to
    replenish this card with tokens (up to your Spellcast trait). At the end of
    each session, clear all unspent tokens.</p>
