  description: >-
    <p>Goblins are small humanoids easily recognizable by their large eyes and
    massive membranous ears. <span class="og-omit">With keen hearing and sharp
    eyesight, they perceive details both at great distances and in darkness,
    allowing them to move through less-optimal environments with ease. Their
    skin and eye colors are incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant
    or subdued, more dominant than another. A typical goblin stands between 3–4
    feet (0.9–1.2 m) tall, and each of their ears is about the size of their
    head. Goblins are known to use ear positions to very specific effect when
    communicating nonverbally. A goblin's lifespan is roughly 100 years, and
    many maintain their keen hearing and sight well into advanced
    age.</span></p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
