    <h3>Level 9 Arcana Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>Once per rest, make a
    Spellcast Roll (15). On a success, drop into a vision that lets you clearly
    see and hear any place you have been before as though you are standing there
    in this moment. You can move freely in this vision and are not constrained
    by the physics or impediments of a physical body. This spell cannot be
    detected by mundane or magical means. You drop out of this vision upon
    taking damage or casting another spell.</p>
