    <h3>Level 1 Midnight Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>When you have a few
    minutes to prepare, you can mark a Stress to don the facade of any humanoid
    you can picture clearly in your mind. While disguised, you have advantage on
    Presence Rolls to avoid scrutiny. Place a number of tokens equal to your
    Spellcast trait on this card. When you take an action while disguised, spend
    a token from this card. After the action that spends the last token is
    resolved, the disguise drops.</p>
