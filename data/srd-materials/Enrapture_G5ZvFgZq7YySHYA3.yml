    <h3>Level 1 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    against a target within Close range. On a success, they become temporarily
    Enraptured. While Enraptured, a target's attention is fixed on you,
    narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your voice.
    Once per rest on a success, you can mark a Stress to force the Enraptured
    target to mark a Stress as well.</p>
