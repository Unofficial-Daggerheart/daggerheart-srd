    <h3>Level 5 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>You can peek into the
    minds of others. Spend a Hope to read the vague surface thoughts of a target
    within Far range. Make a Spellcast Roll against the target to delve for
    deeper, more hidden thoughts. On a roll with Fear, the target might, at the
    GM's discretion, become aware that you're reading their thoughts.</p>
