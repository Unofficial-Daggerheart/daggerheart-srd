    <h3>Level 8 Arcana Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    (14). Once per long rest on a success, you create a layer of illusion over
    your body that makes it hard to tell exactly where you are. Mark any number
    of Stress to make that many additional layers. When an adversary makes an
    attack against you, roll a number of d6s equal to the number of layers
    currently active. If any roll a 5 or higher, one layer of the aura is
    destroyed and the attack fails. If all the results are 4 or lower, you take
    the damage and this spell ends.</p>
