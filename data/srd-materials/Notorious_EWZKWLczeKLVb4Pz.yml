    <h3>Level 10 Grace Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>People know who you
    are and what you've done, and they treat you differently because of it. When
    you leverage your notoriety to get what you want, you can mark a Stress
    before you roll to gain a +10 bonus to the result. Your food and drinks are
    always free wherever you go, and everything else you buy is reduced in price
    by one bag of gold (to a minimum of one handful). This card doesn't count
    against your loadout's domain card maximum of 5 and can't be placed in your
    vault.</p>
