    <h3>Level 2 Arcana Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>Spend a Hope to create
    a single, small floating orb that you can move anywhere within Very Far
    range. While this spell is active, you can see through the orb as though
    you're looking out from its position. You can transition between using your
    own senses and seeing through the orb freely. If the orb takes damage or
    moves out of range, the spell ends.</p>
