    <p>Daggerheart uses the following ranges to translate fictional positioning
    into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, movement, and other
    game mechanics:</p><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Melee:</strong> Close enough to
    touch, up to a few feet away. (1 sq.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Very
    Close:</strong> Close enough to see fine details, about 5–10 feet away. (3
    sq.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Close:</strong> Close enough to see prominent
    details, about 10–30 feet away. (6 sq.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Far</strong>:
    Close enough to see very little detail, about 30–100 feet away. (12
    sq.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Very Far</strong>: Too far to make out any
    details, about 100–300 feet away. (13+ sq.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Out of
    Range</strong>: Anything beyond a character’s Very Far range is Out of Range
    and usually can’t be targeted.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><em>Battlemap
    distances are notes in squares and listed in parentheses. </em></p>
