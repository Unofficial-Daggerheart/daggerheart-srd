    <p>Bards are the most charismatic people in all the realms. <span
    class="og-omit">Members of this class are masters of captivation and
    specialize in a variety of performance types, including singing, playing
    musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. Whether performing for
    an audience or speaking to an individual, bards thrive in social situations.
    Members of this profession bond and train at schools or guilds, but a
    current of egotism runs through those of the bardic persuasion. While they
    may be the most likely class to bring people together, a bard of ill temper
    can just as easily tear a party apart.</span></p><p><span

    Rally Die to roll it, adding the result to their action roll, reaction roll,
    damage roll, or to clear a number of Stress equal to the result. At the end
    of each session, clear all unspent Rally Dice. At level 5, your Rally Die
    increases to a d8.</p>
