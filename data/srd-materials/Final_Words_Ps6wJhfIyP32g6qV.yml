    <h3>Level 2 Splendor Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>You can infuse a
    corpse with a moment of life to speak with it. Make a Spellcast Roll (13).
    On a success with Hope, the corpse answers up to three questions. On a
    success with Fear, the corpse answers one question. The corpse answers
    truthfully, but it can't impart information it didn't know in life. On a
    failure, or once the corpse has finished answering your questions, the body
    turns to dust.</p>
