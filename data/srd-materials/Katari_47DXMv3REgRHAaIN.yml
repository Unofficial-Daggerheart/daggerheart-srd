  description: >-
    <p>Katari are feline humanoids with retractable claws, vertically slit
    pupils, and high, triangular ears. <span class="og-omit">They can also have
    small, pointed canine teeth, soft fur, and long whiskers that assist their
    perception and navigation. Their ears can swivel nearly 180 degrees to
    detect sound, adding to their heightened senses. Katari may look more or
    less feline or humanoid, with catlike attributes in the form of hair,
    whiskers, and a muzzle.</span></p><p class="og-omit">About half of the
    katari population have tails. Their skin and fur come in a wide range of
    hues and patterns, including solid colors, calico tones, tabby stripes, and
    an array of spots, patches, marbling, or bands. Their height ranges from
    about 3–6½ feet (0.9–2.0 m), and they live to around 150 years.</p><h4
