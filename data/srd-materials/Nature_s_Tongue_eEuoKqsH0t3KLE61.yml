    <h3>Level 1 Sage Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>You can speak the
    language of the natural world. When you want to speak to the plants and
    animals around you, make an Instinct Roll (12). On a success, they'll give
    you the information they know. On a roll with Fear, their knowledge might be
    limited or come at a cost. Additionally, before you make a Spellcast Roll
    while within a natural environment, you can spend a Hope to gain a +2 bonus
    to the roll.</p>
