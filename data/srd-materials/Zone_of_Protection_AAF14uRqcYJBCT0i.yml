    <h3>Level 6 Splendor Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    (16). Once per long rest on a success, choose a point within Far range and
    create a visible zone of protection there for all allies within Very Close
    range of that point. When you do, place a d6 on this card with the 1 value
    facing up. When an ally in this zone takes damage, they reduce it by the
    die's value. You then increase the die's value by one. When the die's value
    would exceed 6, this effect ends.</p>
