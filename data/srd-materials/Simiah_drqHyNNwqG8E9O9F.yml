  description: >-
    <p>Simiah resemble anthropomorphic monkeys and apes with long limbs and
    prehensile feet. <span class="og-omit">While their appearance reflects all
    simian creatures, from the largest gorilla to the smallest marmoset, their
    size does not align with their animal counterparts, and they can be anywhere
    from 2–6 feet (0.6–1.8 m) tall. All simiah can use their dexterous feet for
    nonverbal communication, work, and combat. Additionally, some also have
    prehensile tails that can grasp objects or help with balance during
    difficult maneuvers. These traits grant members of this ancestry unique
    agility that aids them in a variety of physical tasks. In particular, simiah
    are skilled climbers and can easily transition from bipedal movement to
    knuckle-walking and climbing, and back again. On average, simiah live for
    about 100 years.</span></p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
