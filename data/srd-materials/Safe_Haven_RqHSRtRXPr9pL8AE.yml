    <h3>Level 8 Codex Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 3</p><p>When you have a few
    minutes of calm to focus, you can spend 2 Hope to summon your Safe Haven, a
    large interdimensional home where you and your allies can take shelter. When
    you do, a magical door appears somewhere within Close range. Only creatures
    of your choice can enter. Once inside, you can make the entrance invisible.
    You and anyone else inside can always exit. Once you leave, the doorway must
    be summoned again. When you take a rest within your own Safe Haven, you can
    choose an additional downtime move.</p>
