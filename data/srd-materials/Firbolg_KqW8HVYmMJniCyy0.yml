    <p>Firbolgs are bovine humanoids typically recognized by their broad noses
    and long, drooping ears. <span class="og-omit">Some have faces that are a
    blend of humanoid and bison, ox, cow, or other bovine creatures. Others,
    often referred to as minotaurs, have heads that entirely resemble cattle.
    They are tall and muscular creatures, with heights ranging from around 5–7
    feet (1.5–2.1 m), and possess remarkable strength no matter their age. Some
    firbolgs are known to use this strength to charge their adversaries, an
    action that is particularly effective for those who have one of the many
    varieties of horn styles commonly found in this ancestry. Though their
    unique characteristics can vary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can
    be muted and earth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as
    soft pinks and blues. On average, firbolgs live for about 150
    years.</span></p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
