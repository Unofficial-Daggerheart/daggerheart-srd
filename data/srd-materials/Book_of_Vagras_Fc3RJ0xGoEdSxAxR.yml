    <h3>Level 2 Codex Grimoire</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Runic Lock: Make a
    Spellcast Roll (15) on an object you're touching that can close (such as a
    lock, chest, or box). Once per rest on a success, you can lock the object so
    it can only be opened by creatures of your choice. Someone with access to
    magic and an hour of time to study the spell can break it. Arcane Door: When
    you have no adversaries within Melee range, make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a
    success, spend a Hope to create a portal from where you are to a point
    within Far range you can see. It closes once a creature has passed through
    it. Reveal: Make a Spellcast Roll. If there is anything magically hidden
    within Close range, it is revealed.</p>
