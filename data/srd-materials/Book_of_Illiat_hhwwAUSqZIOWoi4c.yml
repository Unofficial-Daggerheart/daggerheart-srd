    <h3>Level 1 Codex Grimoire</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Slumber: Make a
    Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Close range. On a success,
    they're Asleep until they take damage or the GM spends a Fear on their turn
    to clear this condition. Arcane Barrage: Once per rest, spend any number of
    Hope and shoot magical projectiles that strike a target of your choice
    within Close range. Roll a number of d6s equal to the Hope spent and deal
    that much magic damage to the target. Telepathy: Spend a Hope to open a line
    of mental communication with one target you can see. This connection lasts
    until your next rest or you cast Telepathy again.</p>
