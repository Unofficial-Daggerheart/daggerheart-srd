    <p>Play the Call of the Slayer if you want to strike down adversaries with
    immense force</p><h6>Foundation
    Feature</h6><p><em><strong>Slayer:</strong></em> You gain a pool of dice
    called Slayer Dice. On a roll with <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-hope"
    data-bs-original-title>Hope</a>, you can place a <strong>d6</strong> on this
    card instead of gaining a <a
    href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/#define-hope"
    data-bs-original-title>Hope</a>, adding the die to the pool. You can store a
    number of Slayer Dice equal to your Proficiency. When you make an attack
    roll or damage roll, you can spend any number of these Slayer Dice, rolling
    them and adding their result to the roll. At the end of each session, clear
    any unspent Slayer Dice on this card and gain a Hope per die
    cleared.</p><h6>Specialization Feature</h6><p><em><strong>Weapon
    Specialist:</strong></em> You can wield multiple weapons with dangerous
    ease. When you succeed on an attack, you can spend a Hope to add one of the
    damage dice from your secondary weapon to the damage roll. Additionally,
    once per long rest when you roll your Slayer Dice, reroll any
    1s.</p><h6>Mastery Feature</h6><p><em><strong>Martial
    Preparation:</strong></em> You're an inspirational warrior to all who travel
    with you. Your party gains access to the Martial Preparation downtime move.
    To use this move during a rest, describe how you instruct and train with
    your party. You and each ally who chooses this downtime move gain a
    <strong>d6</strong> Slayer Die. A PC with a Slayer Die can spend it to roll
    the die and add the result to an attack or damage roll of their choice.</p>
