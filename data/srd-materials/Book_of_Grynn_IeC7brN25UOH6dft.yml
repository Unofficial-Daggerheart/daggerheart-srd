    <h3>Level 4 Codex Grimoire</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Arcane Deflection:
    Once per long rest, spend a Hope to negate the damage of an attack targeting
    you or an ally within Very Close range. Time Lock: Target an object within
    Far range. That object stops in time and space exactly where it is until
    your next rest. If a creature tries to move it, make a Spellcast Roll
    against them to maintain this spell. Wall of Flame: Make a Spellcast Roll
    (15). On a success, create a temporary wall of magical flame between two
    points within Far range. All creatures in its path must choose a side to be
    on, and anything that subsequently passes through the wall takes 4d10+3
    magic damage.</p>
