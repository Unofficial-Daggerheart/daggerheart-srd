    <h3>Level 10 Bone Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Spend 3 Hope to run a
    straight path through the battlefield to a point within Far range, making an
    attack against all adversaries within your weapon's range along that path.
    Choose the order in which you deal damage to the targets you succeeded
    against. For the first, roll your weapon damage with a +1 bonus to your
    Proficiency. Then remove a die from your damage roll and deal the remaining
    damage to the next target. Continue to remove a die for each subsequent
    target until you have no more damage dice or adversaries. You can't target
    the same adversary more than once per attack.</p>
