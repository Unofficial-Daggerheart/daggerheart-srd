    <p>When the characters decide they want to have downtime</p><p>- They choose
    between a short rest and a long rest. </p><p>- <strong>A party can take up
    to three short rests before their next rest must be a long rest</strong>
    </p><p>- If a short rest is interrupted (such as by an adversary’s attack),
    characters don’t gain its benefits. </p><p>- If a long rest is interrupted,
    the characters instead gain the benefits of a short rest (even if they’ve
    already had three short rests).</p>
