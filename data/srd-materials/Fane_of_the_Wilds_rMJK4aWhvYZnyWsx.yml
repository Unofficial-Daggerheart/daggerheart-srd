    <h3>Level 9 Sage Ability</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>After a long rest,
    place a number of tokens equal to the number of Sage domain cards in your
    loadout and vault on this card. When you would make a Spellcast Roll, you
    can spend any number of tokens after the roll to gain a +1 bonus for each
    token spent. When you critically succeed on a Spellcast Roll for a Sage
    domain spell, gain a token. When you take a long rest, clear all unspent
    tokens.</p>
