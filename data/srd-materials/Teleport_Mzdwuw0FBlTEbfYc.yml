    <h3>Level 5 Codex Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Once per long rest, you
    can instantly teleport yourself and any number of willing targets within
    Close range to a place you've been before. Choose one of the following
    options, then make a Spellcast Roll (16): If you know the place very well,
    gain a +3 bonus; If you've visited the place frequently, gain a +1 bonus; If
    you've visited the place infrequently, gain no modifier; If you've only been
    there once, gain a -2 penalty. On a success, you appear where you were
    intending to go. On a failure, you appear off course, with the range of
    failure determining how far off course.</p>
