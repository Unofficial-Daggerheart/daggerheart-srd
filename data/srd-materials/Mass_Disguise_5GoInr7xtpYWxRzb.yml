    <h3>Level 6 Midnight Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 0</p><p>When you have a few
    minutes of silence to focus, you can mark a Stress to change the appearance
    of all willing creatures within Close range. Their new forms must share a
    general body structure and size, and can be somebody or something you've
    seen before or entirely fabricated. A disguised creature has advantage on
    Presence Rolls to avoid scrutiny. Activate a Countdown (8). It ticks down as
    a consequence the GM chooses. When it triggers, the disguise drops.</p>
