  description: >-
    <p><strong>Once per session per player</strong>, each player can choose to
    spend 3 Hope and initiate a <strong>Tag Team Roll</strong> between their
    character and another PC. When you do, work with the other character’s
    player to describe how you combine your actions in a unique and exciting
    way. You both make separate action rolls, but before resolving the roll’s
    outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply for both of your
    results.</p><p><br />On a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. <br
    />On a roll with Fear , the GM gains a Fear for each PC involved.<br /><br
    /><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Both roll damage and add the
    totals together</strong> to determine the damage dealt</p></li><li><p>If the
    attacks deal different types of damage (physical or magic), you choose which
    type to deal.</p></li><li><p>A Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll
    for the purposes of any countdowns or features that track action
    rolls.</p></li></ul><p></p><blockquote><p>Tip: Though you can only initiate
    one Tag Team Roll per session, you can be involved in multiple Tag Team
    Rolls. For example, you might spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team Roll with
    a partner, and the same partner can later spend 3 Hope to initiate one with
    you.</p></blockquote>
