    <h3>Level 9 Midnight Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 2</p><p>Once per long rest,
    choose any targets within Very Close range to perceive you as a nightmarish
    horror. The targets must succeed on a Reaction Roll (16) or become
    temporarily Horrified. While Horrified, they're Vulnerable. Steal a number
    of Fear from the GM equal to the number of targets that are Horrified (up to
    the number of Fear in the GM's pool). Roll a number of d6s equal to the
    number of stolen Fear and deal the total damage to each Horrified target.
    Discard the stolen Fear.</p>
