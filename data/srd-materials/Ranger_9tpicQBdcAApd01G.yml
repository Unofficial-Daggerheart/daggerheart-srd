    <p>Rangers are highly skilled hunters who, despite their martial abilities,
    rarely lend their skills to an army. <span class="og-omit">Through mastery
    of the body and a deep understanding of the wilderness, rangers become sly
    tacticians, pursuing their quarry with cunning and patience. Many rangers
    track and fight alongside an animal companion with whom they've forged a
    powerful spiritual bond. By honing their skills in the wild, rangers become
    expert trackers, as likely to ensnare their foes in a trap as they are to
    assail them head-on.</span></p><p><span

    make an attack against a target. On a success, deal your attack's normal
    damage and temporarily make the attack's target your <em>Focus</em>. Until
    this feature ends or you make a different creature your <em>Focus</em>, you
    gain the following benefits against your <em>Focus</em>:</p><ul

    in.</li><li>When you deal damage to them, they must mark a
