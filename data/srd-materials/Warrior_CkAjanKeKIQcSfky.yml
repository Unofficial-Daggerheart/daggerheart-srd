    <p>Becoming a warrior requires years, often a lifetime, of training and
    dedication to the mastery of weapons and violence. <span
    class="og-omit">While many who seek to fight hone only their strength,
    warriors understand the importance of an agile body and mind, making them
    some of the most sought-after fighters across the realms. Frequently,
    warriors find employment within an army, a band of mercenaries, or even a
    royal guard, but their potential is wasted in any position where they cannot
    continue to improve and expand their skills. Warriors are known to have a
    favored weapon; to come between them and their blade would be a grievous
    mistake.</span></p><p><span
