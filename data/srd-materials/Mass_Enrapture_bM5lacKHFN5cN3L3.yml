    <h3>Level 8 Grace Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 3</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    against all targets within Far range. Targets you succeed against become
    temporarily Enraptured. While Enraptured, a target's attention is fixed on
    you, narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your
    voice. Mark a Stress to force all Enraptured targets to mark a Stress,
    ending this spell.</p>
