    <h3>Level 5 Midnight Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Make a Spellcast Roll
    against a target within Close range. On a success, spend a Hope to conjure
    suppressive magic around the target that encompasses everything within Very
    Close range of them and follows them as they move. The target and anything
    within the area is Silenced until the GM spends a Fear on their turn to
    clear this condition, you cast Hush again, or you take Major damage. While
    Silenced, they can't make noise and can't cast spells.</p>
