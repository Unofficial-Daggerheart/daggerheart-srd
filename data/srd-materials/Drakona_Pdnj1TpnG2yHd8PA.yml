  description: >-
    <p>Drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and possess a powerful
    elemental breath. <span class="og-omit">All drakona have thick scales that
    provide excellent natural armor against both attacks and the forces of
    nature. They are large in size, ranging from 5–7 feet (1.5–2.1m) on average,
    with long sharp teeth. New teeth grow throughout a drakona's approximately
    350-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently losing an
    incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona don't have wings and can't
    fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry pass down the element of
    their breath through generations, though in rare cases, a drakona's
    elemental power will differ from the rest of their family's.</span></p><h4
