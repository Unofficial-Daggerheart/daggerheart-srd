    <h3>Level 1 Splendor Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>You lay your hands
    upon a creature and channel healing magic to close their wounds. When you
    can take a few minutes to focus on the target you're helping, you can spend
    2 Hope to clear a Hit Point or a Stress on them. Once per long rest, when
    you spend this healing time learning something new about them or revealing
    something about yourself, you can clear 2 Hit Points or 2 Stress on them
    instead.</p>
