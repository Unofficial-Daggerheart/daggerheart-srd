    <h3>Level 2 Midnight Spell</h3><p>Recall Cost: 1</p><p>Spend a Hope to
    summon a humanoid-sized spirit that can move or carry things for you until
    your next rest. You can also send it to attack an adversary. When you do,
    make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Far range. On a success,
    the spirit moves into Melee range with that target. Roll a number of d6s
    equal to your Spellcast trait and deal that much magic damage to the target.
    The spirit then dissipates. You can only have one spirit at a time.</p>
