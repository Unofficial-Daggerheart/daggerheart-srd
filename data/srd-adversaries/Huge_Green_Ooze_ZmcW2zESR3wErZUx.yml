    <h1>Details</h1><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><p>A translucent green mound of acid
    taller than most humans.</p><h4>MOTIVES &amp; TACTICS</h4><p>Camouflage,
    creep up, envelop, multiply</p><hr /><h1>EXPERIENCE</h1><p>Blend In
    +3</p><hr /><h1>FEATURES</h1><ul><li>Slow - Passive: When you spotlight the
    Ooze and they don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet.
    Place a token on their stat block and describe what they’re preparing to do.
    When you spotlight the Ooze and they have a token on their stat block, clear
    the token and they can act.</li><li>Acidic Form - Passive: When the Ooze
    makes a successful attack, the target must mark an Armor Slot without
    receiving its benefits (they can still use armor to reduce the damage). If
    they can’t mark an Armor Slot, they must mark an additional
    HP.</li><li>Envelop - Action: Make an attack against a target within Melee
    range. On a success, the Ooze Envelops them and the target must mark 2
    Stress. While Enveloped, the target must mark an additional Stress every
    time they make an action roll. When the Ooze takes Severe damage, all
    Enveloped targets are freed and the condition is cleared.</li><li>Split -
    Reaction: When the Ooze has 4 or more HP marked, you can spend a Fear to
    split them into two Green Oozes (with no marked HP or Stress). Immediately
    spotlight both of them.</li></ul>
