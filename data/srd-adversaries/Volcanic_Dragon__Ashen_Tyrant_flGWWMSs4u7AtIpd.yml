    <h1>Details</h1><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><p>No enemy has ever had the insolence
    to wound the dragon so. As the lava settles, it’s ground to ash like the
    dragon’s past foes.</p><h4>MOTIVES &amp; TACTICS</h4><p>Choke, fly,
    intimidate, kill or be killed</p><hr /><h1>EXPERIENCE</h1><p>Hunt from Above
    +5</p><hr /><h1>FEATURES</h1><ul><li>Relentless (4) - Passive: The Ashen
    Tyrant can be spotlighted up to four times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual
    to spotlight them.</li><li>Cornered - Passive: Mark a Stress instead of
    spending a Fear to spotlight the Ashen Tyrant.</li><li>Injured Wings -
    Passive: While flying, the Ashen Tyrant gains a +1 bonus to their
    Difficulty.</li><li>Ashes to Ashes - Passive: When a PC rolls a failure
    while within Close range of the Ashen Tyrant, they lose a Hope and you gain
    a Fear. If the PC can’t lose a Hope, they must mark a HP.</li><li>Desperate
    Rampage - Action: Mark a Stress to make an attack against all targets within
    Close range. Targets the Ashen Tyrant succeeds against take 2d20+2 physical
    damage, are knocked back to Close range of where they were, and must mark a
    Stress.</li><li>Ashen Cloud - Action: Spend a Fear to smash the ground and
    kick up ash within Far range. While within the ash cloud, a target has
    disadvantage on action rolls. The ash cloud clears the next time an
    adversary is spotlighted.</li><li>Apocalyptic Thrashing - Action: Countdown
    (1d12). Spend a Fear to activate. It ticks down when a PC rolls with Fear.
    When it triggers, the Ashen Tyrant thrashes about, causing environmental
    damage (such as an earthquake, avalanche, or collapsing walls). All targets
    within Far range must make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take
    2d10+10 physical damage and are Restrained by the rubble until they break
    free with a successful Strength Roll. Targets who succeed take half damage.
    If the Ashen Tyrant is defeated while this countdown is active, trigger the
    countdown immediately as the destruction caused by their death
    throes.</li></ul>
