    <h1>Details</h1><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><p>A decaying mage adorned in dark,
    tattered robes.</p><h4>MOTIVES &amp; TACTICS</h4><p>Corrupt, decay, flee to
    fight another day, resurrect</p><hr /><h1>EXPERIENCE</h1><p>Forbidden
    Knowledge +3, Wisdom of Centuries +3</p><hr /><h1>FEATURES</h1><ul><li>Dance
    of Death - Action: Mark a Stress to spotlight 1d4 allies. Attacks they make
    while spotlighted in this way deal half damage, or full damage if you spend
    a Fear.</li><li>Beam of Decay - Action: Mark 2 Stress to cause all targets
    within Far range to make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take
    2d20+12 magic damage and you gain a Fear. Targets who succeed take half
    damage. A target who marks 2 or more HP must also mark 2 Stress and becomes
    Vulnerable until they roll with Hope.</li><li>Open the Gates of Death -
    Action: Spend a Fear to summon a Zombie Legion, which appears at Close range
    and immediately takes the spotlight.</li><li>Not Today, My Dears - Reaction:
    When the Necromancer has marked 7 or more of their HP, you can spend a Fear
    to have them teleport away to a safe location to recover. A PC who succeeds
    on an Instinct Roll can trace the teleportation magic to their
    destination.</li><li>Your Life Is Mine - Reaction: Countdown (Loop 2d6).
    When the Necromancer has marked 6 or more of their HP, activate the
    countdown. When it triggers, deal 2d10+6 direct magic damage to a target
    within Close range. The Necromancer then clears a number of Stress or HP
    equal to the number of HP marked by the target from this attack.</li></ul>
