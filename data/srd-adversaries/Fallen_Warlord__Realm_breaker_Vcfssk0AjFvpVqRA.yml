    Very Close range. When a target uses armor to reduce damage from this
    attack, they must mark 2 Armor Slots.</li><li>All-Consuming Rage - Reaction:
    Countdown (Decreasing 8). When the Realm-Breaker is in the spotlight for the
    first time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, create a torrent of
    incarnate rage that rends flesh from bone. All targets within Far range must
    make a Presence Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d6+10 direct magic
    damage. Targets who succeed take half damage. For each HP marked from this
    damage, summon a Fallen Shock Troop within Very Close range of the target
    who marked that HP. If the countdown ever decreases its maximum value to 0,
    the Realm-Breaker marks their remaining HP and all targets within Far range
    must mark all remaining HP and make a death move.</li><li>Doombringer -
