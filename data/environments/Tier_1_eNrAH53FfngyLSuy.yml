        <h1>Tier 1 Exploration</h1><p>A former druidic grove lying fallow and
        fully reclaimed by nature. <br /><strong>Impulses:</strong> Draw in the
        curious, echo the past<br /><strong>Difficulty:</strong> 11<br
        /><strong>Potential Adversaries:</strong> Beasts (Bear, Dire Wolf, Glass
        Snake), Grove Guardians (Minor Treant, Sylvan Soldier, Young
        Dryad)</p><h2>FEATURES</h2><p><strong>Overgrown Battlefield</strong> -
        Passive:<br />There has been a battle here. A PC can make an Instinct
        Roll to identify evidence of that fight. On a success with Hope, learn
        all three pieces of information below. On a success with Fear, learn
        two. On a failure, a PC can mark a Stress to learn one and gain
        advantage on the next action roll to investigate this environment. A PC
        with an appropriate background or Experience can learn an additional
        detail and ask a follow-up question about the scene and get a truthful
        (if not always complete) answer.</p><ul><li>Traces of a battle (broken
        weapons and branches, gouges in the ground) litter the ground.</li><li>A
        moss-covered tree trunk is actually the corpse of a
        treant.</li><li>Still-standing trees are twisted in strange ways, as if
        by powerful magic.</li></ul><p><em>Why did these groups come to blows?
        Why is the grove unused now?</em></p><p><strong>Barbed Vines</strong> -
        Action:<br />Pick a point within the grove. All targets within Very
        Close range of that point must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or
        take 1d8+3 physical damage and become Restrained by barbed vines.
        Restrained lasts until they're freed with a successful Finesse or
        Strength roll or by dealing at least 6 damage to the
        vines.</p><p><em>How many vines are there? Where do they grab you? Do
        they pull you down or lift you off the ground?</em></p><p><strong>You
        Are Not Welcome Here</strong> - Action:<br />A Young Dryad, two Sylvan
        Soldiers, and a number of Minor Treants equal to the number of PCs
        appear to confront the party for their intrusion.</p><p><em>What are the
        grove guardians concealing? What threat to the forest could the PCs
        confront to appease the Dryad?</em></p><p><strong>Defiler</strong> -
        Action:<br />Spend a Fear to summon a Minor Chaos Elemental drawn to the
        echoes of violence and discord. They appear within Far range of a chosen
        PC and immediately take the spotlight.</p><p><em>What color does the
        grass turn as the elemental appears? How does the chaos warp insects and
        small wildlife within the grove?</em></p>
