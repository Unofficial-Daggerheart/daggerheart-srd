        <h1>Tier 4 Traversal</h1><p>An otherworldly space where the laws of
        reality are unstable and dangerous.<br /><strong>Impulses:</strong>
        Annihilate certainty, consume power, defy logic<br
        /><strong>Difficulty:</strong> 20<br /><strong>Potential
        Adversaries:</strong> Outer Realms Monstrosities (Abomination,
        Corruptor, Thrall)</p><h2>FEATURES</h2><p><strong>Impossible
        Architecture</strong> - Passive:<br />Navigating this realm requires a
        Progress Countdown (8). On a failure, PCs also mark
        Stress.</p><p><em>What does it feel like to move in a space so alien to
        the Mortal Realm? What landmark or point do you fixate on to maintain
        your balance?</em></p><p><strong>Everything You Are This Place Will Take
        from You</strong> - Action:<br />Countdown (Loop 1d4). On trigger, all
        PCs must roll Presence or lose 1d4 from their highest trait unless they
        mark Stress equal to its value.</p><p><em>How does this place try to
        steal from you that which makes you
        legendary?</em></p><p><strong>Unmaking</strong> - Action:<br />Spend a
        Fear to force a Strength Reaction Roll. Fail: 4d10 magic damage;

        catch while this place tries to unmake you?</em></p><p><strong>Outer
        Realms Predators</strong> - Action:<br />Spend a Fear to summon an
        Abomination, a Corruptor, and 2d6 Thralls. One takes the spotlight. You
        may spend another Fear for an auto-hit.</p><p><em>What half-consumed
        remnants of the shattered world do these monstrosities cast aside in
        pursuit of living flesh?</em></p><p><strong>Disorienting
        Reality</strong> - Reaction:<br />On a roll with Fear, prompt the PC to
        name a fear. PC loses a Hope. If it's their last, gain a
        Fear.</p><p><em>What moment do they see? How hard will it be to hold on
        to the real memory?</em></p>
