        <h1>Tier 2 Event</h1><p>A Fallen cult assembles around a sigil of the
        defeated gods and a bonfire that burns a sickly shade of green.<br
        /><strong>Impulses:</strong> Profane the land, unite the Mortal Realm
        with the Circles Below<br /><strong>Difficulty:</strong> 14<br
        /><strong>Potential Adversaries:</strong> Cult of the Fallen (Cult
        Adept, Cult Fang, Cult Initiate,
        Secret-Keeper)</p><h2>FEATURES</h2><p><strong>Desecrated Ground</strong>
        - Passive:<br />Cultists dedicated this place to the Fallen Gods, and
        their foul influence seeps into it. Reduce the PCs' Hope Die to a d10
        while in this environment. The desecration can be removed with a
        Progress Countdown (6).</p><p><em>How do the PCs first notice that
        something is wrong about this place? What fears resurface while hope is
        kept at bay?</em></p><p><strong>Blasphemous Might</strong> - Action:<br
        />A portion of the ritual’s power is diverted into a cult member to
        fight off interlopers. Choose one adversary to become Imbued with
        terrible magic until the scene ends or they’re defeated. An Imbued
        adversary immediately takes the spotlight and gains one of the following
        benefits, or all three if you spend a Fear:</p><ul><li>They gain
        advantage on all attacks.</li><li>They deal an extra 1d10 damage on a
        successful attack.</li><li>They gain the feature: <strong>Relentless
        (2)</strong> - Passive. This adversary can be spotlighted up to two
        times per GM turn.</li></ul><p><em>How does the enemy change in
        appearance? What fears do their blows bring to the
        surface?</em></p><p><strong>The Summoning</strong> - Reaction:<br
        />Countdown (6). When the PCs enter the scene or the cult begins the
        ritual to summon a demon, activate the countdown. Designate one
        adversary to lead the ritual. The countdown ticks down when a PC rolls
        with Fear. When it triggers, summon a Minor Demon within Very Close
        range of the ritual’s leader. If the leader is defeated, the countdown
        ends with no effect as the ritual fails.</p><p><em>What will the cult do
        with this leashed demon if they succeed? What will they try to summon
        next?</em></p><p><strong>Complete the Ritual</strong> - Reaction:<br
        />If the ritual’s leader is targeted by an attack or spell, an ally
        within Very Close range of them can mark a Stress to be targeted by that
        attack or spell instead.</p><p><em>What does it feel like to see such
        devotion turned to the pursuit of fear and domination?</em></p>
