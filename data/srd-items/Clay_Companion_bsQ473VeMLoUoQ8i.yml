  description: >-
    <p>When you sculpt this ball of clay into a clay animal companion, it
    behaves as that animal. For example, a clay spider can spin clay webs, while
    a clay bird can fly. The clay companion retains memory and identity across
    different shapes, but they can adopt new mannerisms with each form.</p>
